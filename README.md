Module 17


## Overview of Loan Prediction Risk Analysis

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to address the challenge of credit card risk. Credit risk is unbalanced as good loans outnumber risky loans so additional techniques are needed to counteract this. This analysis uses six different techniques to sample the data and reduce bias. 

## Credit Analysis Results
* The Oversampling algorithm.

## Credit Analysis Summary
The bike sharing app is a good investment. Seasonality and weather should also be considered when looking at trends and number of rentals. Also growth over time would be valuable, so different years should be compared.
